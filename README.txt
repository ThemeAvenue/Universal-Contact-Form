Highly customizable contact form plugin based on the Bootstrap 3 markup.

== Description ==

This is just another contact form plugin, but built for customization. It is based on Bootstrap 3, which means the forms will render
nicely on most recent themes.

However, it is not uncommon that users need to customize the form's markup. Where most contact forms plugins won't allow you much modifications,
Universal Contact Form lets you change every piece of form markup.

The plugin includes front-end validation (you can decide which field is mendatory and which is not) as well as server-side validation. If the user
fails to fill the form correctly and the front-end validation fails, the form will remember the content of every valid field.

When you need a new form, just create it in your WordPress admin. After you saved it, a shortcode will be generated and you just have to paste this shortcode
wherever you need it.
